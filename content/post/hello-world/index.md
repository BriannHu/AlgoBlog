Welcome to my blog!

Since starting to work full-time, I've found myself missing the late night hours of coding and coffee. To relive those moments... I've decided to create a blog. I'm creating this using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework with Jimmy Cai's [Stack Theme](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack), so I can focus more on the content itself (besides, who likes frontend?).

Here, I'll be documenting a list of algorithms and data structures that I find useful or interesting, with heavy inspiration from:

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) 
- [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/)
- Introduction to Algorithms, by CLRS

For easier navigation, use the handy search function that this theme provides, or filter by catagories/tags.

Hope you enjoy!
